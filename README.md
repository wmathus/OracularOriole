# OracularOriole  

## Overview  
OracularOriole is a web-based software tool designed to analyze **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) genetic variants** and their relationship with **positive selection in South Asian populations**. This project is part of the **MSc Bioinformatics Software Development Group Project 2025**.  

## Features  
- **Retrieve genetic variant (SNP) information** based on rsID, genomic coordinates, or mapped genes.  
- **Integrate T2D-associated variants** with population genomic and functional data.  
- **Generate visualizations** for positive selection signals in chosen populations.  
- **Provide downloadable analysis results** for further exploration.  
- **Handle missing queries gracefully.**
